# Audio Training Overview

The audio training will be broken into three parts:

 1. [Basics](#Basics)
 2. [Advanced](#Advanced)
 3. [Board Specific](#Board-Specific)

The content will follow a very specific route, working first from how audio gets from one place to another and then moving to the processing why, how, and best practices. Everyone is encouraged to follow the initial order and then utilize the videos in any order as reference material.

## Basics

The basics will be constructed via the following order:

3. [The Stage](#The-Stage)
4. [The Board](#The-Board)
