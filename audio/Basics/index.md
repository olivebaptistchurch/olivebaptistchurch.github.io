# Basics

## What we do

As an audio engineer your job, at its most basic level, is to take what is being played on stage and allow it to be heard by the congregation. In other words, get audio from the stage to the speakers and help it sound as natural as possible. Of course, there are some effects and processing that we can do from a creative perspective, but we will touch on those later in the process.

## Terminology

Before we dive in to the foundations of audio, let's go over a few key terms that you will see throughout the training course:

Mono
: This means one. In terms of audio in means that all of the audio only comes down one channel, as opposed to two for Left and Right.

Stereo
: Stereo allows two channels of audio, one for left and one for right. Typically, when listening on headphones the audio is stereo.

XLR Cable
: An XLR cable is a three pin cable that allows long runs of audio without interference.

1/4" Cable
: This cable allows us to do short runs from instruments. This can either be unbalanced or balanced cables, or tip sleeve (TS) and tip ring sleeve (TRS).

Direct Box
: A direct box transforms the unbalanced high-impedance signal from an instrument to a balanced low-impendance signal that can travel a longer distance.
