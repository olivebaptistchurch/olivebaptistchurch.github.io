# Production Training

Thank you for being a part of the production team at Olive Baptist Church! Everything that goes on in the room, online, and at each campus happens because of the dedication and devotion each of you brings to the team. To help you further learn how to craft your skill, we have put together this collection of training documents, videos, manuals, and files for your use at home. We look forward to seeing what God is able to continue doing through each of you and this ministry!

> Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men

> -- Colossians 3:23

## Why We Exist

In the last 100 years our world has drastically changed. The main form of entertainment and media went from books and words to videos and the internet. As a result, the church has adapted to utilize the new tools to reach a wider and more diverse audience for the furthering of the Gospel.

Our role in the church is to help take the message, worship, and evangelism from the church walls and proclaim them throughout the city, state, and nations. Furthermore, we are able to come alongside both the pastor and worship team to help bring visual aid and storytelling to what they are doing. Through lights, sound, and IMAG (Image Magnification), we are able to amplify what is being presented on the platform.

Everything we do centers around the Word of God and the vision of the pastor. Our desire is to come behind the person God has placed as shepherd of our local church and help him fulfill the vision God has placed on his heart.
